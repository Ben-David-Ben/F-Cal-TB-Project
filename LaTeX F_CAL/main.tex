\section{Introduction}
Particle physics has been studied for a long time and many of the known models today describe the behaviors of systems under no external fields, or weak fields which can be modeled by using perturbation theory and linear approximation.In LUXE, we study Quantum Electro Dynamics(QED) under strong external fields, where the behavior becomes non-perturbative. In this regime we investigate some special phenomena.

One main goal of the LUXE experiment is to study the \textbf{nonlinear Compton (NLC) process} where an electron or positron absorbs n optical photons, $\gamma_L$, from laser background and converts them into a single, high-energy gamma photon.

\begin{equation}
    e^{\pm} + n \gamma_L \longrightarrow e^{\pm} + \gamma
\end{equation}

Another target of the LUXE experiment is the \textbf{nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process} where high energy photons produces an electron-positron pair.

\begin{equation}
    \gamma + n \gamma_L \longrightarrow e^+ + e^-
\end{equation}

To study this realm, we will experiment with high energy electron beam and high voltage lasers, the experiment system is built in collaboration with DESY where the electron accelerator is based.







\section{Experiment System}



A key operation for the experiment will be to capture the positrons created in the Breit-Wheeler process and determine their energies. To obtain this, we will use a sensor composed of layers of silicone semi conductors and Tungsten ($W_{74}$).
The silicone is divided to channels connected to external voltage. when high energy charged particles interact with the silicone it causes an ionization and an electrical charge transmittance. by converting this charge into digital signal, we can learn the trajectory of a particle in the sensor by seeing which channels were creating the signal.
The Tungsten, being a heavier material, is used in order to reduce the particles energy, as particles interact with it, they undergo an electromagnetic shower, in which they break down into more particles with lower momentum.the width of each tungsten layer is 3.3 mm  which results with the highest probability of the particle to create only two more particles.
In our sensor we will have multiple such structures of silicone and Tungsten layers, which are referred to as \textbf{Towers}. The towers will be placed next to each other in order to cover the surface area needed to capture the positrons.
\\ \\



\section{Gap Between Towers}

Between every two towers is a distance of \ben{check dist between towers} where we have a "blind spot" in the sensor. The goal of this section is to present how this blind spots affect the accuracy of the sensor.

Average amplitude in each channel, planes 0 (first) and 7 (last). the average was taken by the total amplitude of each channel, divided by the total amount of hits in the channel, for the specific plane. One can notice that for the channels at the area of the electron beam, the amplitudes at plane 7 are bigger than in plane 0, while on the channels located further, there is no significant change in the reading. It is important to state that there is a tungsten layer before the first silicone layer (plane 0) and this is may cause the scattering of electrons to reach the channels further from the electron beam area. however, most of the electron that reached this far lose more energy, and in average will stamp a lower amplitude than the ones in the beam area.}

\end{figure}








\FloatBarrier
The reason for the peaks in fig (\ref{1101-amp-histo-plane-1}) can be explained by the Minimum Ionizing particle (MIP), where particles of high energy will cause a minimum amount of energy loss when passing through the silicone. The amount of lost energy in such case will be translated to a digital signal with amplitude of around 15 ADC. Since the electrons also undergo a shower in tungsten before reaching the first plane, the most probable outcomes are of either 1 particle leaving 1 MIP - around 15 amp or after multiplying in the shower we will have 2 leaving 2 MIP - 30 amp or 3 particles leaving 3 MIP - 45 amp. which explains the peaks at 17, 28 and 42.

We can on the right the amount of hits in each plane, as expected, it grows bigger as the particle goes deeper in the sensor, However, in plane 4 there was probably some malfunction in the sensor as we see a major drop in comparison to the other planes. As for the energies, we see that the average amp per plane grows bigger until plane 5 and then starts to descend. The absolute average amp behave similarly, except for plane 4 which have significantly less hits and therefore lower amplitude.}

In figure (\ref{AVG-energy-per-X-1063}) we see the average energy of an event given the column of the first pad that was activated. This run occurs close to the Gap (between columns 11 and 12) and we see indeed how the energy is decreased for the events starting in these columns.

In figure (\ref{Energy-histo-per-X-1063}) we have the histograms of energies of all showers which activated only a single pad in the first plane, for different columns of initiation. we see a difference in the center of the peak, as for the columns closer to the gap the energies are lower. we remind that in run 1101 (fig. \ref{Energy histo per X 1101}) all energies are around 4220.

We also see a drop in plane 2 for some of the columns. There is also a drop in plane 5, this might occur because this is at a depth of the sensor where the shower is close to its peak, meaning that we also have a large amount of leakege to the Gap.
