Missions:

- find in the logbook the runs done for two towers with equvilent amount of layers.

- schedule a talk with david

- analizing the gap:
    1. compare the run around the gap with one around the center.
        11. compare energies(amplitude)
        12. compare hits amount

    2. compare the first plane with the latter planes
        22. energies
        23. hits    

    3. with the telescope, find the energies and hits of each position around the gap
