Missions:

- simulation

- calibration values

- gap ~ 1.7

- NN pad corrections - dystance between x_sensor and x_scope


"pad edges"
- organize the plots of the sigmoid width for left and right

- plot the widths for top and bottom of the pad as well (y axis)

-organize the plots of the inner and outer gap

- plot neighboring pads outside the gap
