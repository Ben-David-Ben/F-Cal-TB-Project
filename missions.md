Missions:

- find in the logbook the runs done for two towers with equvilent amount of layers around the gap.

- schedule a talk with david

- analizing the gap:
    1. compare the run around the gap with one around the center.
        - compare energies(amplitude)
        - compare hits amount

    2. compare the first plane with the latter planes
        - energies
        - hits    

    3. with the telescope, find the energies and hits of each position around the gap

    - is the first layer silicone or thungstane?

- look for average amplitude in the sensor
