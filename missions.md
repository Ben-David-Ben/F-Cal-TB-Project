Missions:

- with the telescope, find the energies and hits of each position around the gap


- consider why the energies are not equal for all events with different starting points

- make a energy histogram per location

- amount of hits(over amount of events) in each plane for different distances

- get the energy per plane for different locations

- shower radius
