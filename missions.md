- gaussian fit the energy histograms per column

- compare energies of different pads around the gap with a sample "ideal" pad

- talk to halina about the parameters needed when presenting an histogram

- add RMS to histo

- cut x value where you can see better

- telescope

- ask michal about the runs at the end of the shower, use variance addition to connect them
